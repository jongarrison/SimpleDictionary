# A very basic dictionary for Arduino

Perhaps this should have been called "DangerousDictionary"

This does not have many of the features you would expect in a fully featured dictionary. The performance is not ideal. The behavior when overfilling it is not ideal. The way that you properly interact with it will be altered by the types you provide to the template.

BUT within its limitations this can be very useful for holding basic configuration settings that might be loaded from an SD card for example. 

This code was inspired by: https://forum.arduino.cc/t/dictionary-object/651568/8

# Usage

Several example dictionaries in use are shown in ./examples/BasicUsage

# Collaboration

I would welcome improvements to this library! I got it working for my specific use case, but I do think this is worth some improvement. I may get to this when future projects require.
